### Project Overview
This HR analytics project for Palmora Group focuses on evaluating key workforce metrics, including gender distribution, salary structure, regional pay differences, performance ratings, and compliance with the new $90,000 minimum wage regulation. It also includes the allocation of bonuses based on employee performance.

#### Key Insights
   1. Gender Distribution by Region & Department
      - Overall gender split:
         - Female: 49.15%
         - Male: 44.12%
         - Unspecified: 6.73%
      - Gender representation is fairly balanced.
      - Gender distribution was further broken down across regions (Lagos, Abuja, Kaduna) and departments, enabling HR to monitor diversity more accurately.

   2. Performance Ratings by Gender    
       - Ratings were originally in text format (e.g., Very Good, Average, etc.) and were converted to numeric scores.
       - Analysis showed that Male and Female employees have similar average performance ratings, with no significant disparity.
       - Most employees fall into the ‚ÄúGood‚Äù or ‚ÄúVery Good‚Äù categories.

   3. Company Salary Structure & Gender Pay Gap
       - A gender pay gap was identified:
       - Male employees tend to receive higher average salaries across most regions and departments.
       - Breakdown by department and location revealed that some departments (e.g., Legal, Marketing) and regions (e.g., Abuja) exhibit wider gender-based salary differences.
       - These areas should be prioritized by management for a pay equity audit.

   5. Minimum Salary Compliance
       - The new regulation mandates a minimum annual salary of $90,000 for all employees.
       - The analysis found 654 employees earn below this threshold, indicating non-compliance.
       - Employees were grouped into salary bands (e.g., $90K‚Äì$100K, $100K‚Äì$110K, etc.) and analyzed by region.
       - Kaduna has the highest share of underpaid employees and total salary spend, making it the key region for compliance intervention.

   6. Bonus Allocation Based on Ratings
       - Bonus amounts were calculated using a separate dataset containing rules based on performance ratings.
       - A total of $2.20M was allocated as bonuses company-wide.
       - Each employee‚Äôs total compensation (salary + bonus) was calculated.
       - Summary of bonus allocation:
       - Kaduna received the highest share of total bonus payout.
       - Bonus distribution aligns with performance rating scores.

### Recommendations
   - Address salary non-compliance immediately, especially in Kaduna.
   - Investigate and resolve gender-based pay gaps, focusing on specific departments and regions.
   - Improve data completeness by minimizing ‚ÄúUnspecified‚Äù gender entries.
   - Continue using performance-based bonus structures, but ensure fairness and transparency.

### Tools Used
   - Power BI Desktop
   - DAX for calculated measures (e.g., average salary, bonus logic)
   - Tooltip customization
   - Slicers and filters for user interactivity
